NOTE: It requires Node.js (https://nodejs.org)

Download the GitHub energy-community-game folder and simply run start.bat.

Troubleshooting

In case of problems, you can recreate the folder and dependencies as follows:

Run the following commands in the Windows shell (Start -> Command Prompt):

npx create-react-app energy-community-game
cd energy-community-game
npm install lucide-react recharts

----------
Replace src/App.js with:

import EnergyGame from './EnergyGame';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <EnergyGame />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

----------

Copy the src/EnergyGame.js from GitHub in the src folder just created.

Finally, just double-click on the "start.bat" file to run the game.
